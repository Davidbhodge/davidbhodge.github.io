&lt;p&gt;I was using Coleslaw and trying to make it work with github pages - which is turned out much harder than I would have thought. Symlinks are not handled properly as far as i can see.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, I found another system called Site Generator and after some futzing around with it its working. There is a lot more work to getting it going, but you can sure do a lot with it - and it does not have those nasty symlinks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This turned out to be far too work, so i thought (foolish me) to go with the mainstream and move to Jekyll. Hoo Boy. If I thought I had a problem , well I had multiple problems. The short summary is that Jeyll relies on an XML parser called nokogiri that soes not play nicley with osx when usig Macports. I gave up after becoming far too closely acquainted with the ruby world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I am back to coleslaw , using the GH-PAGES plugin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lets see how this will work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have to say that I am astonished how hard this has all been.&lt;/p&gt;
